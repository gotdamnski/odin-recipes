    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Century eggs are a traditional Asian dish featuring eggs that have been preserved for a long period of time in a curing mixture. Although they appear dark in color, they are rich in flavor and considered a delicacy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>24 quile eggs</li>
      <li>12 ounces of water</li>
      <li>5 tea bags or 4 teaspoons of black tea</li>
      <li>2.5 ounces kosher salt</li>
      <li>1.5 ounces food-grade or edible sodium hydroxide or lye</li>
      <li>.002 ounces food-grade zinc</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Prepare the black tea mixture by bringing water to a boil in a small
          pot.</strong
        >
        Turn off the heat and add the black tea bags and salt. Allow the water
        to cool down to room temperature and then remove the tea bags.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the sodium hydroxide and zinc.</strong> Be sure you are
        wearing protective gloves and that you are in a well-ventilated area as
        sodium hydroxide is dangerous if touched or ingested. With your gloves
        on, slowly pour the sodium hydroxide and the zinc into the black tea
        mixture. Use a stainless steel spoon or utensil to stir the mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Using your gloves or a stainless steel spoon, carefully lower each
          egg into the mixture.</strong
        >
        Once all of the eggs are in the pot, cover it with a lid and seal the
        pot with tape. Write the date on the pot so you know when you made them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Store the eggs.</strong>You’ll want to store the pot in a cool
        and dark location where it won’t be disturbed. Leave the pot for roughly
        12 days.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Using your protective gloves, uncover the pot and remove the
          eggs.</strong
        >
        Rinse the brine off of the eggs and then let them dry for one hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Place the eggs into a plastic, sealable bag.</strong> Then
        place them in a light-proof container, such as a pot with a lid. Store
        them again in a cool and dark location where they won’t be disturbed.
        Leave them for at least 30 days.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove the eggs from your container.</strong> Bring a
        medium-sized pot of water to a boil and then place the eggs in the
        boiling water for one minute. After one minute transfer them to a bowl
        of ice water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Gently tap the eggs against a hard surface to crack the shell and
          then peel off the entire shell.</strong
        >
        Your century eggs should be dark green or black and are now ready to
        eat. You can serve them with sliced or pickled ginger root, soy sauce,
        Sichuan sauce, or sesame oil.
